            <h2>No drones over national lab</h2>
            <p>LOS ALAMOS, N.M. (AP) — Drone pilots beware. Authorities at one of the nation’s top nuclear weapons laboratories issued a warning Monday that airspace over Los Alamos National Laboratory is off limits. The birthplace of the atomic bomb, Los Alamos lab reported that recent unauthorized drone flights have been detected in restricted airspace in the area. Officials said if you fly a drone over the lab, you likely will lose it. According to the FAA, drones are prohibited from flying over sites designated as national security sensitive facilities.

            <h2>Cybersecurity Investment</h2>
            <p>WASHINGTON (AP) — Some of the country’s leading technology companies have committed to investing billions of dollars to strengthen cybersecurity defenses and to train skilled workers, the White House announced Wednesday following President Joe Biden’s private meeting with top executives. The Washington gathering was held during a relentless stretch of ransomware attacks that have targeted critical infrastructure and major corporations, as well as other illicit cyber operations that U.S. authorities have linked to foreign hackers.

            <h2>Robots</h2>
            <p>Mike Snider (USA TODAY) — The robots are coming, and Elon Musk wants to usher in their arrival. The Tesla CEO revealed the Tesla Bot this week during an event devoted to advances in AI. Described as "the next generation of automation," the humanoid robot is "capable of performing tasks that are unsafe, repetitive or boring." That makes sense as there are many jobs needing done but humans don't want to do, Musk says. "What is the economy? At the foundation it is labor," he said during the event. "So, what happens when there is no shortage of labor?"

            <h2>Luxury Tech</h2>
            <p>Ben Oliver (CAR & DRIVER) — Croatian EV startup Rimac has taken control of Bugatti, with two new Bugatti models engineered by Rimac set to appear by 2030. A 2000-hp hybrid hypercar with a naturally aspirated combustion engine comes first, followed by Bugatti's first full EV. The deal sees Rimac, which was founded in 2009 and to date has delivered only a handful of cars, take majority ownership of a marque established a century earlier and with one of the most illustrious histories in the automotive world.

              <h2>Jeff vs. Elon</h2>
              <p>Mark Whittington (THE HILL) - Say what you will about Jeff Bezos, but he is not a quitter when it comes to getting a contract that he believes is his due. When NASA awarded a sole contract to Blue Origin’s main rival SpaceX for the Human Landing System (HLS) that will take Americans back to the moon, Bezos, as well as another contractor, Dynetics, complained to the General Accounting Office (GAO). On July 30, the GAO denied the protests. Congress provided only enough money for one HLS, at least for the first round. NASA found that SpaceX offered a superior design. The fact that Elon Musk offered the lowest bid did not hurt either.</p>
